# Color Themes

These files provide color themes for the installer. All themes are their dark variants.

Color format is `#RRGGBBAA`

Each theme should include an `assets` folder which includes images to override the base theme with. The [recolor](../scripts) script should be useful for generating new assets.

The `adwaita` theme is merely a reference file, it is not actually used by the installer.
