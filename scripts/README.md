# Scripts

These scripts are for project maintenance purposes.

Users should not concern themselves with them.

## update_classes

The purpose of this script is to update specific css classes should they change.

It is fairly unlikely that this would occur, but this is here just in case.

The classes are grabbed from steam's `steamui/css` folder, simply run and the codebase should be updated.
