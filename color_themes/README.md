# Color Themes

These files provide color themes for the installer.

Color format is `#RRGGBBAA`

The `adwaita` theme is merely a reference file, it is not actually used by the installer.

# Limitations

Parts of the UI are constructed from image based assets, these themes will not change those elements.
